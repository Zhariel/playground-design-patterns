# Exercise 1: Strategy pattern

## Goal

Use the [Strategy pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) to implement a small program that complies with the specification.

Unit tests are already done for you. You should read these tests to implement carefully your program.

The exercise is considered as **complete** when all unit tests provided pass.

## Specification

A customer on an ecommerce website has multiple options to pay its order:

- Either he can pay by card
- Or he can pay by cash

When customer pays by cash, there is a service charge of $5.00 to pay with the original price.

When customer pays by credit card, the service charge of $5.00 is still applied. However, the payment provider asks the customer a $10.00 payment processing fee in addition to the amount already paid.

## Going further (optional)

How could you refactor your program to use the latest Java language features?
